                <p class="cs-text">
                    I'm Mason, the founder and sole developer here at Champlain Valley Web Design. For the past decade, I've been knee-deep in various tech roles, from being a Network Technician to steering projects and wearing multiple hats in the industry. My goal? Empowering small businesses with the tech tools they need to thrive in today's digital landscape.                </p>
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    In my interactions with small businesses, I've noticed a recurring challenge: many struggle to afford a high-quality website upfront. Those who did invest often ended up with sites that seemed like they'd been frozen in time for a decade! They were caught in a tough spotâ€”unable to afford a decent website and unsure who to trust for modern design. So, I devised a business model tailored to these needs. That's how the $150-a-month subscription model was born. It's my way of making top-notch website development more accessible to small businesses without straining their budgets.
